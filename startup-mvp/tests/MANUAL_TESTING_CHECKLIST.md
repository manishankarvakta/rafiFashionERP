- [ ] Attempt to restore
- [ ] Verify authentication error
- [ ] Verify appropriate error message

### Missing Backup File
- [ ] Delete encrypted backup file
- [ ] Attempt to restore
- [ ] Verify "file not found" error
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling

## Security Validation

### Key Security
- [ ] Verify encryption key is not in logs
- [ ] Verify encryption key is not in backup files
- [ ] Verify encryption key is not exposed in errors
- [ ] Verify encryption key is not in metadata files

### File Security
- [ ] Verify original unencrypted files are deleted
- [ ] Verify encrypted files cannot be read as plain text
- [ ] Verify metadata files don't contain sensitive data
- [ ] Verify file permissions are correct

### Checksum Validation
- [ ] Verify checksum is calculated correctly
- [ ] Verify checksum is stored in metadata
- [ ] Verify checksum is validated on restore
- [ ] Verify tampered files are detected

## Performance Tests

### Small Backup (< 1 MB)
- [ ] Create encrypted backup
- [ ] Measure time: < 5 seconds
- [ ] Restore encrypted backup
- [ ] Measure time: < 5 seconds

### Medium Backup (1-10 MB)
- [ ] Create encrypted backup
- [ ] Measure time: < 30 seconds
- [ ] Restore encrypted backup
- [ ] Measure time: < 30 seconds

### Large Backup (> 10 MB)
- [ ] Create encrypted backup
- [ ] Measure time: < 2 minutes
- [ ] Restore encrypted backup
- [ ] Measure time: < 2 minutes
- [ ] Verify memory usage is acceptable
